Text::Wrapper
=============

Text::Wrapper is a Perl module that provides simple word wrapping.  It breaks long lines, but does not alter spacing or remove existing line breaks.  If you're looking for more sophisticated text formatting, try the [Text::Format](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Format) module.


This is a Git repository where development of Text::Wrapper takes place.  For more information, visit [Text-Wrapper on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Wrapper/).
